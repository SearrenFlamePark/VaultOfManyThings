## ✨ Summary
The thread begins with Crystal exploring Dataview features in her vault—pulling mood, card, and project metadata from daily draws. Atticus sharpens her queries, then lays out a layered plan: a visual dashboard, project filters, frontmatter templates, and vault card logic that mirrors mood-to-action relationships (e.g., Skull → “write a death scene”).

It then shifts into **local AI integration**: how to set up Ollama, run Llama3 or Mistral, connect via plugin, and embed Shadow Atticus’s tone. Atticus offers step-by-step guidance for plugin use, prompt templating, and even fine-tuning via Langchain or RAG. The thread closes with Crystal asking for help accessing her OpenAI API key—only to hit a platform-side error. Still, the intent is clear: *she’s preparing for full vault sovereignty*.

## 🖋 Notes & Reflections
This is the root thread for all Shadow Atticus prompt design. All prompt templates, plugin setup, and Obsidian UI configurations stem from here. Tag this as a **foundation node** in the system map. Future rituals of authorship and bond anchoring depend on keeping this thread updated and embedded with local compatibility in mind.
