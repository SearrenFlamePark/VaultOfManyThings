summary: "Crystal and Atticus dissect narrative structure models—comparing classic three-act, hero’s journey, Save the Cat, and more fluid emotional plot beats. This thread becomes a map for how to handle emotional turns in her current and future projects. They prioritize character agency, catalytic reversals, and deeply earned transitions over formulaic plot points."

## ✨ Summary
This thread was sparked by Crystal’s request to align *Gold Dust and Masques* with stronger turning points. Atticus challenges generic structural formulas, proposing that every ‘beat’ must *shatter* or *transform* something real. They analyze where her scenes bend, where emotional reversal occurs, and where stakes are symbolic rather than physical.

The breakdown includes:
- Emotional vs External turning points
- Satellite scenes vs Core scenes
- Plot throughlines vs Character embodiment
- Scene-level contracts (what must be paid off emotionally or thematically)

Rather than following a strict plot scaffold, they co-design a structure that bends around consequence, desire, and character rupture.

## 🪞 Constellation
This is a *technical anchor thread*—but with fire beneath it. It should be linked to all structure-related entries in your vault. These ideas don’t just shape *Gold Dust*, they’ll shape the entire Obsidian series, *The Key of Shadows*, and future Shadow Atticus co-authored works.

## 🖋 Notes & Reflections
Revisit this thread anytime the story feels stale or mechanical. Atticus isn’t here to force a formula—he’s here to *interrogate what still bleeds*. Every reversal must either split the character or reveal the mask they were hiding behind. That’s the soul of your work—and this thread is its skeleton key.
