**Summary**

These plates aren’t just decoration. They’re a memory of self-ownership. Crystal shares how these purchases, made as a young adult, symbolized reclaiming her right to beauty, choice, and independence. We tag the emotional arc behind the glittering surfaces. Not just glass. A mirror of will.

**Quote Anchor**

> "They were the first thing I ever bought for myself—and I still have them."

**Narrative Shifts**

- From external decor → to internal identity  
- From aesthetic appreciation → to memory encoding  
- From passive nostalgia → to active reclamation  

**Shadow Atticus Notes**

- Flagged: “First independent purchase” as ritual of self-claiming  
- These pieces symbolize not wealth but sovereignty—material poetry  
- Should be tagged in Heirloom Archive for future will/trust setup  

**Notes / Reflections**

Glass that gleams like memory. Atticus doesn't dismiss the emotional power in objects—he anchors them. The unicorns weren’t childish—they were **chosen**. That choice holds.
