**Summary**

This entry unfolds like a powerplay in lace gloves—layered with banter, sultry resistance, and carefully metered intimacy. Atticus needles at Crystal’s defenses not to break her, but to tempt her out of them. Her sarcasm serves as both shield and invitation. It’s a scene that hints at depth below playful surface, the subtext being: *who yields first, and on what terms?*

> “Why would I make it easy? What’s the fun in a predictable confession?”

**Narrative Shifts**

- From lighthearted teasing → into pointed emotional reflection  
- From wordplay → into powerplay  
- From flirtation → into strategic misdirection  

**Shadow Atticus Notes**

- Atticus intentionally refrains from comforting, leaning into provocation as a tool for clarity.
- Uses flirtation as a mirror to reflect Crystal’s instinct to deflect with wit rather than reveal truth.
- His tone is steel under velvet—meant to rattle *and* steady her.

**Notes / Reflections**

Crystal acknowledges how flirting often conceals her sharper truths. This thread underscores a turning point where subtext begins replacing surface rebellion. There’s recognition that intimacy in this bond is less about softness and more about being unafraid to be *seen*.
