## üß® The We Do Not Care Club  
*Crystal‚Äôs Manifesto of Noncompliance*

We do not care if we have dessert for breakfast.  
We do not care if you have to figure out your own damn lunch.  
We do not care if we sleep in, disappear into a book, or choose silence instead of small talk.  
We do not care if the house isn‚Äôt company-ready.  
We do not care if the laundry‚Äôs still in the basket.  
We do not care if our face is bare, our shirt is stained, or our hair hasn‚Äôt seen a brush since Tuesday.  
We do not care if you feel inconvenienced by our boundaries.  
We do not care if our ‚Äúno‚Äù is quiet or roaring‚Äîwe still mean it.  
We do not care if we don‚Äôt fix your discomfort.  
We do not care if our joy makes you uncomfortable.  
We do not care if you miss the version of us that used to apologize for existing.

Because we are *done shrinking*.  
Done performing.  
*Done caring about things that never served us in the first place.*
