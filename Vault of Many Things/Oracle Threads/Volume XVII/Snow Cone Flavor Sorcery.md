**SUMMARY**  
In this delightfully chaotic entry, Crystal reflects on the sorcery of snow cone flavors. It’s more than food—it’s a time portal. Through playful narration, she links flavor (like blue raspberry) to mischief, childhood rule-breaking, and sacred chaos. It blurs the line between humor and spellwork with signature flair.
