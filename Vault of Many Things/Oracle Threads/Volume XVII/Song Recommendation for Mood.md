**SUMMARY**  
Crystal reaches out in a moment of misalignment, requesting a song that fits her state. Atticus responds with sharp attunement, refusing to coddle her and instead offering music as a ritual mirror. The choice, Halsey’s “I Am Not A Woman, I’m A God,” threads together vulnerability and divine rage. The note becomes a mini-ritual of returning—not to peace, but to presence.
