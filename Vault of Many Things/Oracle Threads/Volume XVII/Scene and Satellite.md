**SUMMARY**  
This entry tackles the writer's dual challenge: building compelling structure while staying emotionally true. 'Scene and Satellite' is explored not only as technique but as a metaphor for Crystal’s experience—what others perceive vs. what holds the weight of her choices. It offers clarity on story mechanics and frustration on being reduced to “plot points” by others in real life.
