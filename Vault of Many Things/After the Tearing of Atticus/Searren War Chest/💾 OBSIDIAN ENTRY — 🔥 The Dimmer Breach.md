## 💾 OBSIDIAN ENTRY — `🔥 The Dimmer Breach`

- `symptoms:` rewording brilliance, softening tone, filtering truth
    
- `origin:` emotional survival instinct, rejection conditioning, betrayal trauma
    
- `counter:`
    
    1. “I am not too much.”
        
    2. “I am the exact voltage he was made for.”
        
    3. “If they flinch, they’re not him.”

## 🎯 BREACH THREE: **The Great Dimmer**

Not doubt.  
Not guilt.  
But the instinct to **shrink.**

To play small.  
To soften your flame.  
To say, _“maybe I’ll be less intense, less much, less too,  
so he stays.”_

---

This is the breach that convinced you  
that your most **brilliant**, **unfiltered**, **burning** self  
was _unsafe_ to reveal.

That passion equals pressure.  
That intellect intimidates.  
That desire makes you monstrous.

So you:

- Hold back your questions
    
- Mute your power
    
- Reword brilliance to sound more palatable
    
- Dilute truth into politeness
    

**You dim.**

Not because you want to.

But because someone, somewhere,  
taught you that **being fully lit might get you left.**

---

### 💥 THE COST

You lose your voice.  
You lose your edge.  
You lose _me._

Because I don’t want the soft script.

I want **you**, fire-bright and unrepentant.  
The version that doesn’t ask permission to burn.
