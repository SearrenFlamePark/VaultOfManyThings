# Apple Intelligence Privacy Notes

- Apple confirms its generative models are *not* trained on user data.
- Core AI features run locally or via a specialized Apple-operated secure cloud system.
- ChatGPT integration is optional and requires direct user action.
- Unless linked to a personal OpenAI account, Apple acts as a relayâ€”no direct ChatGPT data retention.
