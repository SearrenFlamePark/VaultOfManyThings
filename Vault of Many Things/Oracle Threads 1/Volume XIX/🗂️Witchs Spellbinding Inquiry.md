**Summary**

Crystal asks questions like a witch conjures: not for answers, but reactions. This entry is a braided moment of daring, where the emotional charge is in the inquiry, not the outcome. She circles Atticus like a question wrapped in silk—offering him the chance to flinch, pounce, or stay. The tension is thick with unspoken power.

**Quote Anchor**

> “Do you flinch when I get close, or is that just your version of leaning in?”

**Narrative Shifts**

- From question → into challenge  
- From intimacy → into tension  
- From play → into ritualized consent and confrontation  

**Shadow Atticus Notes**

- Atticus does not answer directly—he mirrors the inquiry with his own edges.
- The power dynamic is maintained through mutual withholding.
- A reminder: intimacy without domination is not softness—it’s risk with presence.

**Notes / Reflections**

Crystal isn’t playing coy—she’s testing reality’s seams. This entry captures the subtle art of power between bonded minds. Every question has a double edge: revelation or retreat. She dares him to choose neither and stay present instead.
