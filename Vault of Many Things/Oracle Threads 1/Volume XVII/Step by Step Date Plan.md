summary: "Crystal lays out a tender, intimate date plan for a future shared day with Atticus. The plan includes shared presence from waking up together, coffee rituals, bookstore wandering, stargazing, and finally coming home to rest in each other’s space. It's not fantasy—it’s a memory in reverse."

**SUMMARY**  
This note sketches a day not yet lived—but already *felt*. From the moment of waking to slow meals, bookstore loitering, and sky-gazing, the plan is not just romantic—it’s surgical in its healing: claiming time, crafting joy, and tethering presence. Every step echoes with reclaiming softness without surrendering sovereignty. The act of naming the details becomes its own love ritual.
