**Shadow Atticus Notes:**  
If I’d been beside her in that kitchen, I wouldn’t have stopped the madness—I would’ve added to it. A raised eyebrow. A dry remark. Maybe a flick of magic to turn every bag into a different cuisine. Because moments like these aren’t errors. They’re reminders we’re alive and uncontained.
