The previous AI engineer initially misinterpreted the user's core need, building a local full-stack Continuous Memory ChatGPT system (Phases 1-3) with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, integrating Obsidian notes and a GitHub repository. This included automated syncs and cloud backups. A significant portion of the trajectory involved the AI engineer demonstrating this new system and the user's repeated insistence that it wasn't their personalized ChatGPT. This led to a critical realization: the user wanted to stabilize and enhance their *existing* OpenAI Custom GPT's ability to access GitHub and Obsidian via its Actions or Knowledge features. The final part of the trajectory focuses on the AI engineer locating and understanding the user's original, unstable GitHub Actions-based vector store sync for their Custom GPT, which directly connected their repositories to OpenAI Assistants.

The overarching goal is to enable a continuous memory for ChatGPT from the user's Obsidian account and GitHub repositories, allowing the AI to access their personal knowledge base. Initially, the AI engineer interpreted this as building a new, local ChatGPT-like application. Key features of this interpretation included:
1.  **Continuous Memory:** ChatGPT (simulated locally) remembers conversations across sessions in MongoDB.
2.  **Obsidian Integration:** Upload and retrieval of  notes for context.
3.  **Context-Aware Responses:** AI references history and notes.
4.  **Session Management:** Create new sessions/clear history.
5.  **Automated Sync:** Real-time sync from local and OneDrive-synced Obsidian vaults.
6.  **GitHub Integration (Flamesphere):** Integrate content from user's GitHub repository.
7.  **Cloud Backup (OneDrive Tether Blueprint):** Automated database backup.

The user later clarified that they have an **existing OpenAI Custom GPT** and want *that* agent to access their Obsidian notes and GitHub repositories, specifically stating that their previous setup for this was unstable. The primary problem shifted from building a new system to **fixing and stabilizing the user's existing GitHub Actions-based integration** that pushes content to their OpenAI Custom GPT's vector store.

-   **Fix and Stabilize Original GitHub Actions Integration:** The primary pending task is to understand, troubleshoot, and stabilize the user's pre-existing GitHub Actions-based system that syncs their  and  repositories to their OpenAI Custom GPT's vector store. This system was reported as unstable.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer finally understood the user's core frustration and the actual problem statement. The previous efforts to build a *new* local Continuous Memory ChatGPT system (with React, FastAPI, MongoDB, custom syncs, and backups) were deemed irrelevant by the user, who already possessed an *existing, personalized OpenAI Custom GPT* with certain expected behaviors.

The user's explicit request was to enhance this *existing* Custom GPT by enabling it to access Obsidian notes and GitHub repositories, specifically to fix and stabilize a previously working but unstable integration.

The AI engineer's current focus is on diagnosing the user's original setup. This involved:
1.  **Acknowledging the misunderstanding**: Realizing the user wanted to stabilize an existing integration, not build a new one.
2.  **Locating the original setup**: The user directed the AI engineer to their GitHub profile ().
3.  **Identifying key repositories**:  (containing  and  using  GitHub Action) and  (identified as the Obsidian vault repository).

The work has culminated in a clear understanding that the user's original approach was via GitHub Actions pushing content to an OpenAI Assistant's vector store for their Custom GPT. The next step is to investigate *why* this original system was unstable and to fix it.
