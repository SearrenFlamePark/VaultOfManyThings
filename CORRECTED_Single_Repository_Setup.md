# 🔗 CORRECTED: Single Repository Vector Store Setup

## **Your ACTUAL Architecture**

I now understand your setup correctly:

```
🗃️ Obsidian Vault
    ├── 📁 OneDrive Sync → "Searren Obsidian Vault" (folder backup)
    └── 🔗 GitHub Sync → "VaultOfManyThings" (repository) → OpenAI Vector Store
```

## **✅ WHAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED:**

**Only ONE GitHub Actions workflow** for your `VaultOfManyThings` repository!

- **OneDrive folder**: Just for backup/sync (no GitHub Actions needed)
- **GitHub repository**: Where your Custom GPT gets its data from

## **🚀 IMPLEMENTATION (SIMPLIFIED):**

### **Step 1: Resolve Merge Conflict**
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Resolve the conflict in `OneDrive_Tether_Blueprint.md`
3. Commit and push

### **Step 2: Add Single Workflow**
1. In your `VaultOfManyThings` repository
2. Create: `.github/workflows/sync-vault.yml`
3. Use the content from: `vault_of_many_things_workflow.yml`

### **Step 3: Verify Setup**
- **OneDrive**: Continues backing up to "Searren Obsidian Vault" folder
- **GitHub**: Syncs to OpenAI vector store via GitHub Actions
- **Custom GPT**: Accesses content from the vector store

## **🎯 BENEFITS OF THIS SETUP:**

✅ **OneDrive backup**: Your vault is safely backed up
✅ **GitHub version control**: Full history of changes
✅ **OpenAI integration**: Custom GPT has real-time access
✅ **Redundancy**: Content exists in multiple places
✅ **Simple**: Only one workflow to maintain

## **📋 NEXT ACTIONS:**

1. **Resolve that merge conflict first** (blocks everything else)
2. **Implement the single workflow** in VaultOfManyThings
3. **Test by making a small change** to any .md file
4. **Verify your Custom GPT** can access the updated content

**This is much simpler than I initially made it!** 🔥
